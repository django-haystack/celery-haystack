v0.6.1 (2012-06-27)
-------------------

* Fixed logging setup.

v0.6 (2012-06-27)
-----------------

* **backwards incompatible change**

  Added support for `django-celery-transactions`_ to make sure the tasks
  are respecting Django's transaction management. It holds on to Celery tasks
  until the current database transaction is committed, avoiding potential
  race conditions as described in `Celery's user guide`_.

  This is **enabled by default** but can be disabled in case you want
  to manually manage the transactions::

      CELERY_HAYSTACK_TRANSACTION_SAFE = False

* Refactored the error handling to always return a message about what
  happened in every step of the index interaction. Raises exception about
  misconfiguration and wrong parameters quicker.

* Improved support for multiple search indexes as implemented by
  Haystack 2.X. Many thanks to Germ√°n M. Bravo (Kronuz).
